        <p>Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani was born on 19 April 1957 in the British Crown colony of Aden (present-day Yemen) into a Gujarati Hindu family to Dhirubhai Ambani and Kokilaben Ambani. He has a younger brother Anil Ambani and two sisters, Nina Bhadrashyam Kothari and Dipti Dattaraj Salgaonkar.

        Ambani lived only briefly in Yemen because his father decided to move back to India in 1958[8] to start a trading business that focused on spices and textiles. The latter was originally named "Vimal" but later changed to "Only Vimal".[9][10] His family lived in a modest two-bedroom apartment in Bhuleshwar, Mumbai until the 1970s.[11] The family's financial status slightly improved when they moved to India but Ambani still lived in a communal society, used public transportation, and never received an allowance.[12] Dhirubhai later purchased a 14-floor apartment block called 'Sea Wind' in Colaba, where, until recently, Ambani and his brother lived with their families on different floors.></p>
